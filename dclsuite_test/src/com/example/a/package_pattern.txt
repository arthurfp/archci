In this package, follow the following guidelines for test assurance:

- Classes should start with "A" followed by a three digit number. For example: A001, A002, A003, etc.
- The first digit indicates the kind of constraint, as follows:
	0 - Access
	1 - Declare
- Methods in these classes should be called "f". When there is more than one method, the name should be followed by a number. For example: f1, f2, f3, etc.

- Objects in these classes should start with "obj" followed by the A, B, C or D, depending on the module that will use the object.

- Fields in these classes should start with "field" followed by the A, B, C or D, depending on the module that will use the field.

- All violations should happen in classes in this package. For example, MA cannot-access MB and
  there is a class AXX (in MA) that accesses a field or invokes a method of a class BXX (in MB).
