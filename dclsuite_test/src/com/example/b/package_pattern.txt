In this package, follow the following guidelines for test assurance:

- Classes should start with "B" followed by a three digit number. For example: B001, B002, B003, etc.
- The first digit indicates the kind of constraint, as follows:
	0 - Access
	1 - Declare
- Methods in these classes should be called "g". When there is more than one method, the name should be followed by a number. For example: g1, g2, g3, etc.

- Objects in these classes should start with "obj" followed by the A, B, C or D, depending on the module that will use the object.

- Fields in these classes should start with "field" followed by the A, B, C or D, depending on the module that will use the field.
