In this package, follow the following guidelines for test assurance:

- Classes should start with "D" followed by a three digit number. For example: D001, D002, D003, etc.
- The first digit indicates the kind of constraint, as follows:
	0 - Access
	1 - Declare
	
- Objects in these classes should start with "obj" followed by the A, B, C or D, depending on the module that will use the object.

- Fields in these classes should start with "field" followed by the A, B, C or D, depending on the module that will use the field.
