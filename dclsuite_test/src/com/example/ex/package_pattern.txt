In this package, follow the following guidelines for test assurance:

- Classes should be subclasses of an Exception type, e.g., Exception
- Classes should start with "Ex" followed by a three digit number. For example: Ex001, Ex002, Ex003, etc.
- The first digit indicates the kind of constraint, as follows:
	0 - Access
	1 - Declare
- Methods in these classes should should be called "ex". When there is more than one method, the name should be followed by a number. For example: ex1, ex2, ex3, etc.
